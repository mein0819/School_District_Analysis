# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze testing scores in relation to school district data and to replace
possibly corrupt data while keeping the clean original data intact. 
The analysis provides the following:
- Comprehensive data frames for the entire district, each school within the district and every student within the district
- Data frames that show math, reading and overall passing percentages based on specified criteria:
      1. Grade level
      2. Per student spending
      3. School Size
      4. School type
- Corrupt data has been replaced for all 9th grade students at Thomas High School with NaNs
